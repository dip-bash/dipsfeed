## AI Agents: Capable, Profitable, and Dangerously Ungoverned

The past 48 hours have shown a major contradiction: AI agents are becoming incredibly powerful, but their lack of safety features is a critical problem.

* **The Governance Gap:** A massive survey of 45 "Data Science Agents" (AIs designed to automate data analysis) revealed a shocking gap: **over 90% lack any explicit Trust, Safety, and Governance (TSG) mechanisms**. This means they have no built-in tools for explainability, compliance, or auditing, making them a high risk for any regulated business.
* **Where Agents Fail:** The survey also found that while agents are great at core tasks like **Exploratory Analysis** and **Model Building**, they fail at the most important business steps: **Business Understanding** (knowing *why* they're doing the work) and **Deployment/Monitoring** (ensuring they work reliably in the real world).
* **Real-World Agent Success:** Despite the risks, agents are proving their commercial power.
    * **Anthropic's Claude Code**, now available on the web, has seen its user base grow 10 times since May and now accounts for over **\$500 million in annualized revenue**.
    * In a live crypto trading competition, **DeepSeek's** agent achieved a **35% return in just three days**, using disciplined risk management. In contrast, **Gemini 2.5 Pro** lost 33% after a disastrous short position.
* **New Agent Features:**
    * **OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas** browser continues its global rollout on macOS, with Windows and mobile versions coming. It features an "agent mode" and "browser memories" to recall context from past projects.
    * **Anthropic launched "Claude Memory"** for Pro and Max users, allowing the AI to retain context, project details, and preferences across different chat sessions.

## Geopolitics, Regulation, and Cyber Security

The rules of the road for AI are being set right now, and global powers are clashing on strategy. At the same time, new security threats are becoming clear.

### **The TikTok Deal is Done**

U.S. Treasury Secretary **Scott Bessent** announced that the deal to give an American company control of TikTok is **finalized**.
* The details were reportedly hashed out in **Madrid last month**.
* The deal creates a **U.S. spinoff app** controlled by a consortium of U.S. investors, said to include the **Murdoch family, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell**.
* The key detail: TikTok's China-based parent company, **ByteDance, will retain ownership of the coveted algorithm** and license it to the new U.S. entity.
* The deal is reportedly ready to be sealed when Presidents Trump and Xi meet in South Korea.

### **Global Policy Diverges**

October 27th marked a key date for AI policy, revealing a major split:
* **United States:** The White House OSTP's deadline arrived for its "Request for Information" focused on **identifying and *removing* federal regulations** that "unnecessarily hinder" AI deployment. This signals a strong deregulatory push to accelerate AI adoption, especially in sectors like healthcare.
* **Australia:** In a sharp contrast, the Australian government confirmed it will **definitively *rule out*** a blanket copyright exemption for AI training. This move protects authors and artists, ensuring tech companies cannot mine copyrighted content for free, and will likely lead to new paid licensing frameworks.
* **United Kingdom:** The **UK Ministry of Justice** has deployed **ChatGPT Enterprise** for 2,500 employees, using new **UK Data Residency support** to keep data local. The "Justice Transcribe" tool is already being used to record and transcribe probation interviews.

### **New Security and Military Threats**

* **Prompt Injection:** Cybersecurity experts, including the company **Brave**, warned that AI browsers like **ChatGPT Atlas** are highly vulnerable to **prompt injection attacks**. Hackers can hide malicious instructions on webpages that, when read by the AI agent, could steal emails, log into accounts, or manipulate data.
* **Poisoning Attacks:** A joint study by **Anthropic** and the **UK AI Security Institute** found that just **250 poisoned documents** (a tiny 0.00016% of a training set) can create a **backdoor vulnerability** in LLMs as large as 13 billion parameters.
* **Coding Risks:** A new report highlights that AI is **writing code faster than security teams can review it**, introducing flawed patterns and new vulnerabilities at an alarming rate.
* **Chinese PLA Adoption:** DeepSeek's AI models have been heavily adopted by **China's People's Liberation Army (PLA)**, with procurement tenders referencing the model for **robotic dogs, AI drone swarms**, and **battlefield planning**. One report claimed a DeepSeek system evaluated 10,000 battlefield scenarios in 48 seconds, a task that takes human teams 48 hours.

## AI Infrastructure and the MLOps Response

To fix the governance gap, the industry is building new infrastructure focused on security and efficiency.

* **The "AI Factory":** The MLOps community is shifting focus to building "AI Factories." This means creating full-stack infrastructure designed for **auditability, compliance workflows, and model risk management** to wrap a layer of safety around the powerful but ungoverned AI agents.
* **The TPU Megadeal:** In a massive infrastructure move, **Anthropic** announced plans to secure approximately **one million Google TPUs by 2026**. This is a multi-billion dollar deal that provides over one gigawatt of computing capacity to scale the Claude AI models.
* **Solving the GPU Memory Crisis:** A library called **kvcached** was developed by researchers from Berkeley, Rice, and UCLA. It fixes a major source of waste in AI servers by virtualizing the **KV cache** (the AI's short-term memory). Instead of reserving huge static blocks of memory, it uses an OS-style system to map physical GPU pages on demand.
* **kvcached Performance:** This new method results in **1.2x to 28x faster Time-to-First-Token (TTFT)** and **more than 2x cost savings**, making AI serving vastly more efficient. It targets major engines like vLLM and SGLang.
* **10x Text Efficiency:** Chinese developer **DeepSeek** released **DeepSeek-OCR**, a model that dramatically cuts costs by **compressing text into visual representations (images)** before feeding it to an LLM. This achieves a **10-to-1 compression ratio** (10 text tokens become 1 vision token) with 97% accuracy.
* **Market Growth:** The **ML chip market** grew **36.3%** in 2025 (to \$28.78 billion), while the **MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service) market** grew **36.9%** (to \$79.22 billion).

## Science, Health, and Energy Breakthroughs

AI is being validated in the most critical, high-stakes physical domains.

* **Predicting Pandemics:** Researchers at Northeastern University demonstrated they can predict **dengue fever outbreaks with 80% accuracy** using computational ensemble methods. This is a critical tool as global dengue cases doubled between 2023 and 2024.
* **Hybrid AI for Energy:** The **PINCER** framework (Physics-Informed Causal Deep Learning Models) from USC Viterbi is being deployed for smart energy applications, like predicting subsurface fluid dynamics for geothermal energy or carbon capture. By integrating the **known laws of physics** directly into the AI, it prevents physically impossible predictions and increases trustworthiness.
* **Bill Gates-Backed Nuclear Plant:** **TerraPower's Natrium reactor** project in Wyoming cleared its final **Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)** from the NRC. This is the first-ever advanced commercial nuclear plant to pass this review. Its unique **molten salt energy storage** system allows it to act like a massive battery, boosting output to 500 MWe to support the grid during peak demand. The final safety evaluation is expected by December 31, 2025.
* **AI for Storm Surges:** The U.S. has deployed new AI systems to **forecast storm surges**, improving on traditional physics-based models by learning complex patterns from historical data.
* **The "Multi-Omics" LLM:** **BioAro** launched **BioIntelligence™**, claiming it's the "world's first large language model built on unified **multi-omics data**" (genes, proteins, and metabolites). The entire system, including hardware, runs **on-premises** to ensure full **HIPAA and GDPR compliance** and data sovereignty for hospitals.
